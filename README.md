# PT-K---MS3

## How to run?
1. Unzip our zip file.
2. Navigate into extracted folder.  
3. Open the `index.html` file with your favorite browser.

## Usage
- It works best when the browser window is full size of the screen. The UI is responsive but it still get a bit messed up when the window size is too small.
- Edit categories is not yet implemented. However, the app should be working fine without this feature.
- Add categories allows you to add as many categories as the user wants, however in our implementation only one category can be added if the user wants to add transactions in the new category.
- The day view popup up will not adjust properly when you add transactions.
- Click on the graphs to expand and see the data details.
